## About the piece

[Étude No. 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tude_No._1_(Villa-Lobos)) is an arpeggio study that is predominantly focused on a cross-string right-hand technique with the exception of one scalar passage from bar measure 23 to 24 and a series of cadential harmonics in measures 31 to 32.

Even though you cannot accomplish the piece as a whole, approaching the right hand arpeggio pattern is very beneficial as suggested by many renowned guitarists:
